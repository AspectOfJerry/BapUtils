## Features (TBD)

<details open>
  <summary>Here some features we would like to add</summary>

- Better dragon name in the m7 boss fight (might not happen because there is already a sbe/skytils feature that let you
  do this).
- Display dragon HP.
- Display dungeon secret route (might not happen or will take a really long time to make).
