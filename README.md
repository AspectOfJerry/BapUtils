# BapUtils

Welcome to BapUtils, a Hypixel Skyblock mod that we will work on this summer.

This is our first Minecraft mod for servers, so if there are any bugs or issues with the mod, please open an issue on
GitHub or contact us on Discord (@tomassy or @jerrydev).
So far, we haven't done much besides thinking about the features.

For more information, please see <https://bap.jerrydev.dev>. <https://jerrydev.net/bap> will be available later.

## development

- Gradle JVM: Java 17
- Project SDK: Java 1.8

## Features *(TBD)*

<details>
  <summary>Dungeons</summary>

- Trust feature to let other players take your own party if you go afk.
- Better dragon name in the m7 boss fight (might not happen because there is already a sbe/skytils feature that let you
  do this).
- Display dragon HP.
- Display dungeon secret route (might not happen or will take a really long time to make).
