# BapUtils

Welcome to BapUtils, a Hypixel Skyblock mod that we will work on this summer.

This is our first Minecraft mod for Hypixel Skyblock, so if there are any bugs or issues with the mod, please open an
issue on
GitHub or contact us on Discord (@tomassy or @jerrydev).

For more information, please see <https://bap.jerrydev.dev>. <https://jerrydev.net/bap> will be available later.

## Features (TBD)

<details open>
  <summary>Here some features we would like to add</summary>

- Better dragon name in the m7 boss fight (might not happen because there is already a sbe/skytils feature that let you
  do this).
- Display dragon HP.
- Display dungeon secret route (might not happen or will take a really long time to make).

</details>

## Socials

- Our Discord server is currently private, and we do not have an estimated time of when it will be made public for
  BapUtils. You can contact @tomassy or @jerrydev on Discord for the moement.
